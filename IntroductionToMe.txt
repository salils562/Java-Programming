Hi I am salil sharma. I am the enginnering student in UIT-RGPV , Bhopal (M.P). I am pursuing B.tech
in Information Technology, I have completed my 10+2 from Jyoti senior secondary school , Rewa(M.P).
MY hobbies Include Coding and playing badminton. 

This folder includes all my java programs that I have created till now. So first of all I would like 
to tell you something about java.
Java is a pure Object oriented programming language which was made in Sun microsystems. Java was first
introduced by sir James Gosling and It was first given name as Oak. Then, after It was named java.
Basically, java is platform independent language, which follows the principle of write once compile anywhere.

Thanks,
Salil sharma.
